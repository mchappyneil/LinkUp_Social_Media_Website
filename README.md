# LinkUp_Social_Media_Website
A social media website side project I built for a high school Computer Science class. It runs on Pythonâ€™s Flask framework and uses a SQLite database to keep track 
of users.

The main program is run from 'app.py'.

Credit for the display time code (disTime .js) goes to Simon Waldherr, and normalize .css to MIT.
